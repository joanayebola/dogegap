    <h2 style="margin: 20px 0;">Admissions Process</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Doge Gap homeschool! We are excited that you are considering our program for your child's education.
        Our admission process is designed to ensure a smooth transition and provide the necessary information for
        enrollemnt. <br> Below is an overview of the steps involved:</p>

    <div class="admissions-process">
        <h3>Step 1: Submit an Application</h3>
        <p>The first step is to complete and submit the application form. You will need to
            obtain a physical copy of the application form from our admissions office. The application form collects
            essential information about
            your child and helps us understand their educational background and needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="admissions-process">
        <h3>Step 2: Schedule an Interview or Assessment</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving your completed application, we will schedule an interview or assessment, depending on the
            grade level and program. This step allows us to get to know your child better and assess their readiness for
            our homeschool program. It is also an opportunity for you to ask any questions you may have.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="admissions-process">
        <h3>Step 3: Provide Required Documents</h3>
        <p>As part of the admissions process, we require certain documents to complete your child's enrollment. These
            may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proof of age (birth certificate or passport)</li>
            <li>Previous academic records or transcripts (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Immunization records (as required by local regulations)</li>
            <li>Any other relevant educational or medical documentation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please have these documents prepared and ready to submit upon request.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="admissions-process">
        <h3>Step 4: Acceptance and Enrollment</h3>
        <p>Once the application, interview or assessment, and required documents are reviewed, we will notify you of the
            admission decision. If accepted, you will receive an acceptance letter along with instructions for
            completing the enrollment process.</p>
        <p>During the enrollment process, you will be required to submit additional forms, such as emergency contact
            information, health forms, and media release permissions. These forms ensure that we have the necessary
            information to provide a safe and enriching learning environment for your child.</p>
        <p>Upon completing the enrollment forms and submitting any required fees, your child's place in our homeschool
            program will be secured.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="admissions-process">
        <h3>Step 5: Orientation</h3>
        <p>Prior to the start of the academic year, we conduct an orientation session for enrolled students and their
            parents. This session provides important information about our curriculum, policies, and expectations,
            allowing for a smooth transition into our homeschool program.</p>
