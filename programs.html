    <h2>Assessment and Grading</h2>

    <p>At Doge Gap Homeschool, we believe in comprehensive assessment practices that focus on student growth, progress,
        and individualized learning. We use a variety of assessment methods to evaluate student performance and provide
        valuable feedback to both students and parents.</p>

    <p>We employ the following assessment and grading practices:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Portfolios:</strong> Students maintain portfolios that showcase their work, including projects,
            assignments, and creative pieces. Portfolios provide a holistic view of student progress and allow for
            self-reflection and growth.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Projects:</strong> We emphasize project-based learning, where students complete in-depth projects to
            demonstrate their understanding of concepts and skills. Projects encourage critical thinking,
            problem-solving, and creativity.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Tests and Quizzes:</strong> We incorporate periodic tests and quizzes to assess students' knowledge
            and understanding of specific subjects or topics. These assessments help identify areas of strength and
            areas that may need additional focus.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Student-Led Conferences:</strong> We believe in involving students in their own learning process.
            Student-led conferences provide an opportunity for students to showcase their work, reflect on their
            progress, and engage in meaningful discussions about their learning journey with their parents or guardians.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We provide regular feedback to parents to keep them informed about their child's progress. Communication channels
        include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Progress Reports:</strong> We issue periodic progress reports that outline students' academic
            achievements, strengths, areas for improvement, and overall progress.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Parent-Teacher Communication:</strong> We encourage open communication between parents and teachers.
            Regular meetings, emails, and other forms of communication are utilized to discuss student performance,
            address concerns, and collaborate on strategies to support the student's learning journey.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Online Platforms:</strong> We utilize online platforms or learning management systems to provide
            real-time access to student assignments, grades, and feedback. This allows parents to stay updated and
            involved in their child's learning process.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>By employing these assessment and grading practices and maintaining open lines of communication, we aim to
        provide a comprehensive understanding of each student's progress and support their continued growth and success.
